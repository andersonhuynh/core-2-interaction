<h1><br>Film Photography Can Never Be Replaced</h1>
<h2>Old-school image-making liberates us from algorithms—and helps us pursue an unfiltered connection with our own creativity.</h2>

<p>CONFIRMATION COMES TIME and again. Film refuses to die.</p>

    When Polaroid abandoned instant film in 2008, a 39-year-old fan named Florian Kaps showed up at an event 
    commemorating the shuttering of the last factory and convinced the company's production manager to join 
    him in making their own product. Kaps' film company, Impossible Project, was so successful that it 
    eventually bought the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaroid_Corporation">Polaroid</a> brand name and branched out to make instant film cameras as well. 


    
    In 2012, Kodak discontinued Ektachrome, its popular 35-mm slide film. But a nascent audience of shutterbugs 
    drove the company to revive Ektachrome five years later; Kodak's film business saw year-over-year growth of 
    21 percent in 2018.Today dozens of first-rate films are readily available at your local Walmart, including 
    Kodak's traditional black-and-white Tri-X 400, Fujifilm's versatile Fujicolor Pro 400H, and, of course, the 
    newly reissued Ektachrome. Buying these films by the cartful, hip designers now tote around cheap Lomo and 
    Holga cameras, relishing the lens flare and light leaks. And then there's Shane Balkowitsch, a Midwestern 
    nurse who never picked up a camera until he saw the spectacularly detailed images made on glass with wet-plate 
    collodion photography, a labor-intensive process used by photographers before roll film became available in 1888. 
    After mastering the essentially obsolete technique, he's made portraits of celebrities, including one of Greta 
    Thunberg in which she appears to be a visionary time traveler.

    The long tail of archaic technologies is normal. Some people still use typewriters and phonographs, never 
    buying into their replacements. Others, like Balkowitsch, fall for old-school methods when they discover 
    communities of committed antiquarians.Yet more than mere legacy is needed for an outmoded technology to become 
    popular. The standard explanation for retro trends, which has been used to account for the return of vinyl records 
    and analog film, is that the future is coming on too fast. And as much as rapid-fire advances seem unavoidable, the 
    arts can provide a refuge. 
    
    Nostalgia is a balm.Just look to the plethora of digital filters that make your shots look 
    like film. The Huji Cam app purposely corrupts perfectly exposed smartphone pics with simulated light streaks (and a 
    faux 1998 date stamp). The more sophisticated VSCO emulates the color gamut of dozens of films, many out of production, 
    so you can set your phone to capture a shot with the high saturation of Agfa Ultra 50 or the soft skin tones of Kodak 
    Portra 150NC.But as closely as software can imitate a vintage rig, and as well as it may hide the fact that you're shooting 
    on an iPhone 11, people still crave the real thing. Digital simulations don't satisfy us, and that points to a deeper reason 
    for analog's persistence.Smartphone photography is fast and easy because it's aided by algorithms. Although skill still matters, 
    the number of variables involved in taking a photo has been engineered to a minimum. That can make digital photography feel cold 
    and artificial, and the digital photographer more like a tool than an artist. Those filters we add, then, personalize pictures 
    that are generically exact already. The algorithms that tweak colors or fake a lens flare let you be imperfect, but only in a 
    perfectly calculated way. Your phone still pwns you. 
    
    The popularity of analog photography can be seen as a reaction to this 
    pwnership—and a manifestation of anxiety that most everything we do is executed by software intermediaries that make decisions on 
    our behalf. Like our smartphone cameras, our Echos and Teslas try to second-guess our desires, as do the social networks where we 
    post our photographs. We're not in control and not fully genuine. Analog photography is dignifying because it's out of the hands of 
    the algorithms, which means it affords you the freedom to make your own mistakes. Suffering the consequences of human error is 
    paradoxically liberating, and a great picture can provide a rush equivalent to winning a marathon.A couple of years ago, when Huji 
    was released, Time asked photographer Stephen Shore what he thought of digital filters. He dismissed them as gimmicks, remarking 
    that a photograph “is good because of the decisions the photographer makes.”
