    <title>How Jacob Elordi Became The New King</title>
    <h2>Euphoria made him Gen Z’s favorite heartthrob. Now, with a breakout role as Elvis, <br>
        Jacob Elordi is transforming into something more: a bona fide movie star.</h2>

        <div><em>The girls are hyperventilating.</em> <br><br>

         It happens spontaneously, as if activated by an aberration in the earth’s magnetic field. 
         <br><BR>
         A blond at nine o’clock lowers her sunglasses, cartoon wolf eyes popping out of her head. 
         <br><BR>
         “Oh, my Goddd,” she exhales, laughing as if she can’t quite believe what she’s staring at.
         <br><br>That would be all six feet, five inches of Jacob Elordi, not so much a <a href="https://mixedneeds.com/products/tall-glass-of-water">tall drink of water</a> as the entire office water cooler. 
         <br><br>
         Despite—or perhaps because of—his gargantuan shades, “James Dean Death Cult” cap pulled low, and zipped-up khaki Saint Laurent jacket, 
         <br> the young actor is unmissable while strolling through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Village">the West Village</a> of Manhattan this fall Saturday afternoon.
         <br>
         Sure enough, a pair of 20-something women slink behind him with secret agent stealth.<br><Br>
         “Jacob? Oh, my God. Hello? Can we take a photo with you? Thank you,” says the brunette.
         “We’re huge fans,” the blond explains.</div>
         <br><br>
         “I’m, like, shaking,” the brunette adds.
         A photo is taken, pleasantries are exchanged, and it’s time to part ways. <br>
         But not before the brunette, overcome in the moment, just has to tell him: You’re beautiful!<br><br>
         <br><br>
            <pre>
            “Thank you,” Elordi says, smiling graciously, like an actual emissary from the planet of the beautiful. 
             “You, too.” His voice is deep, with a native Australian accent that’s been lightly sanded off after spending a quarter of his 26 years in the States. 
            He speaks in low tones, hushed further by the fact that the sound waves have to travel all the way down for the rest of us to hear.
                
            Such are the hazards of being the hot young actor who made his official jump to the big leagues this year. 
            It’s not just the classic, undeniable leading man looks (that jawline belongs in the Jawline Hall of Fame), but what he’s come to symbolize. 
            Think of him as Gen Z’s id, disappearing into complicated roles that run headlong into danger and brim with alluring toxicity: an Abercrombie-catalog 
            jock with a penchant for violence and blackmail in the teen series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8772296/">Euphoria</a>, a doomed paramour in Adrian Lyne’s erotic thriller Deep Water, a hitchhiking 
            serial killer in He Went That Way, a posh aristocrat with an eyebrow piercing in this fall’s wicked drama Saltburn.
            Even when portraying Elvis Presley this fall in Sofia Coppola’s biopic Priscilla, he brings a new dimension to the King, simultaneously ominous and vulnerable. 
            The director told me that she cast Elordi in part because, during their first meeting at a restaurant, “there were some girls there and you could just feel them all turn to him. 
            I mean, he’s striking—so tall. But he just has a charisma, he has an effect on women that I imagine was similar to Elvis.”</pre>
        <br><br>
        <p>Elordi remembers that first meeting with Coppola fondly. “I think those girls might've done me a great service,” he says, grinning.
         For various reasons related to the pandemic, the proliferation of streaming services, and an unfortunate combination of the two, 2023 is actually the first year Elordi has any high-profile movies premiering in theaters, let alone wildly anticipated ones. Now, it seems that not a week can go by without an announcement of a coveted new role with an auteur director. He’s currently in the midst of filming Paul Schrader’s Oh, Canada out on Long Island, inhabiting the younger version of a character played by Richard Gere.
         Schrader thought casting a realistic facsimile would be impossible, until he saw the similarities between Elordi and Gere. “With the exception of the height difference, he has a lot of the very same qualities as Richard. I certainly could have made American Gigolo 40 years ago with Elordi,” the director told me. “He is a throwback, in a way, to a kind of old-time movie star.” He put Elordi in a vintage suit from the ’50s one day and saw the spitting image of Gary Cooper. A larger-than-life silver screen persona—the strong, silent type.
         “The central thing that makes a movie star is mystery,” Schrader continued. “A lot of good-looking kids tend to be in movies, but not that many get to be stars.”
         Elordi does. He has, gradually and then all at once, gained entry into the closest thing we have to the world he grew up revering. He, too, has always idolized Old Hollywood—the James Deans and Marlon Brandos and Steve McQueens. He’s meticulously studied his forebearers’ work, their influences, and even how they handled themselves in interviews.</p>
         <br><br>
            <pre>   
            Now, Elordi finds himself negotiating his own hassles and concerns that come with stardom. People are paying attention to him, looking for cracks in the façade of mystery. 
            They’re invested in his personal relationships (he shuts down any questions about his romantic life with a cheeky “but I appreciate you giving me the space”) and fixated 
            on his personal style (he has been spotted with an array of designer bags to rival any fashion editor’s). As appealing as he is in an old-school way, he still has to deal with 
            the new-school version of fame. This can pain Elordi. He harbors big, artistic ambitions, in an industry hungry to put guys like him in superhero spandex or a streaming property 
            that fans can binge while scrolling through their phones. He deeply values his privacy, even as every outing can result in tabloid photos. Sure, the public has been obsessed with 
            movie stars since they invented movie stars, but at least those guys could still have some mystique. How the hell do you maintain mystique when the world around you is one big, endless 
            TikTok feed? If traversing this part of town during prime boozy brunch is a gauntlet for Elordi, then the neighborhood’s dogs are similarly at risk—from him. He spots a golden retriever 
            (his beloved dog, Layla, is one) up ahead and his reserved mood instantly shifts into a higher gear. He makes a beeline for the dog.
            “Sorry, I’m going to be super rude and just pat his big head,” he says to the dog’s human. “He’s a big boy! He’s a big boy!” The dog accepts the scratches happily, tongue lolling out of 
            his mouth. As we round the corner, we encounter another dog, this time a majestic chow chow that resembles a cumulus cloud granted sentience.
            
            
            “What’s up, dude?” Elordi asks the dog.
            “That’s <a href="https://ankalia.com/blogs/news/muffin-puffin-of-new-york-city">Muffin Puffin</a>,” his owner says, by way of introduction.
            “Hey, Muffin Puffin,” Elordi says, admiringly. “Yeah! Yeah, you are!”</pre>
