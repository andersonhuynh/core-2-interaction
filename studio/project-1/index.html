    <h1 class="small" style="margin-left: 0.2em;">The universe (which others call the <a class="link" href="library.html">Library </a>) 
    is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of Hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very 
    <a class="link" href="railings.html">low railings.</a> From any of the <a class="link" href="hexagon.html">hexagons</a> one can see, 
    interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. <a class="link" href="bookshelf.html">Twenty 
    shelves</a>, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; One of the free sides leads to a <a class="link" href="hallway.html">narrow hallway</a> which opens onto another gallery, identical 
    in the other. Also through here passes a <a class="link" href="staircase.html">spiral stairway</a>, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. 
    In the hallway there is a <a class="link" href="mirror.html">mirror</a> which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each <a class="link" href="hexagon.html">hexagon</a>.
